# Face-Mask-Detection

## Project Description 
This project was inspired by three of my classes for my final semester. I did my CS 4630 Undergraduate Seminar presentation presentation/essay on how facial recognition works using computer vision and machine learning. I am also taking CS 4210 Machine Learning this semester which went into further detail about how neural networks actually work as well as how to train them using python. Lastly, I wanted to learn how to integrate trained machine learning models into a web-app as I learned the entire decvelopment cycle to create a web application from scratch in CS 4800 Software Engineering. This project was inteded to be a culmination of everything I had learned from class and my own research this semester. Machine Learning and AI is one of my major interests as a sub-field of computer science so it was a great opportunity to create something on my own. 

I decided to create a web application using computer vision and machine learning that is able to detect whether people are wearing masks in real time. I also added the ability the recognize the faces that are registered in the database. 

## Training the Mask Detector Model

### 1. Dataset
The Dataset I used was from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/omkargurav/face-mask-dataset) which consisted of 7553 RGB images. It cosisted of 3725 images with masks and 3828 images without masks resulting in the classes being quite balanced.
